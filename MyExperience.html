   This is my Experience in this school
</h2>
<p>
    During my time in middle school I had it really good moments, but my best moments that I've experienced are in a particular class during my early year, in S.H.C.S. So I was basically a new student in these kind of classes and also I'm an English learner. I remember my first presentation in this class. I didn't want to do it, but finally I did it and that one was my best moment. When I went to present I felt afraid, and then when I presented I felt so good for the effort I applied on. Now I feel so much better than my first day of presentations because I now know that I can do whatever I want to do. The learnings that I acquire made it so good this moment because I know that I have to trust on me. something I learnt was that we have to overcome our fears and not let them control ourselves because we can't know our capabilities if we are afraid.
